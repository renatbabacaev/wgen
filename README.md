Wordlist generator that displays all possible variants of character combination taken from entered word/symbols.

**Example**:

User enters "ab" and then lenght of maximum string combination. The program will take all the characters from the string and will generate all string combinations in ascending order.

```txt
User input: ab
Maximum lenght: 5
Minimum lenght: 3
aaa
bbb
aab
...
bbbba
bbbbb
```

## How to run

```txt
gcc wgen.c
```

then

```txt
./compiled > out.txt
```

gen.txt can be any file you want to store output.

## **âš  Caution âš **

Depending on number of characters entered and maximum string length, your wordlist may occupy large amount of disk space.
